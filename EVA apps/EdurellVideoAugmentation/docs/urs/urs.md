### 2.  System Description
#### 2.1  Context
The proliferation of e-learning platforms, MOOCs and online resources has raised new challenges in the field of Education. Video-based learning has seen a rapid growth in the last decade, and during the last year forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, its spread has been exponential. The pandemic situation, moreover, has only speeded up a process that was already under way. Video lessons available on educational portals and on video-sharing platforms have thus hugely grown. 

#### 2.2 Motivations
Educational materials in audiovisual format are designed by teachers or experts in the discipline, to present students with a sequence of educational concepts, highlighting the relevant connections between topics and concepts. However, when made in a poorly structured way, the videos suffer from some limitations that reduce their engagement, for example with excessive length that tempts the learner to follow the video partially or to skip some parts on the progress bar. The creation of augmented video or hypervideo, supported by the presence of a semantic knowledge graph extracted previously, can help the user to obtain a personalized exploration of the contents.

#### 2.3 Objectives
The main goal of the project is the creation of a responsive web app, which allows non-linear consumption of audiovisual content on the basis of a temporal semantic knowledge graph. In this graph nodes represent the concepts explained in the video and arcs are temporal prerequisite relations between the concepts.

The knowledge graph will be provided as input from another project, as well as the pointers that connect the graph nodes to the portions of the video where the related concepts are explained (by timestamp).

#### 2.4 Stakeholders
The stakeholders of this project are university students who approach the study of a discipline as beginners, they need to follow lecture in a video-based education format.

The teachers that will upload their educative videos.

The researchers/students that are working with us on other parts of the project (video annotation/segmentation and graph knowledge )
