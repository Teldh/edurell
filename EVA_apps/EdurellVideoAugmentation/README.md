# Video augmentation and graph exploration

### Short description of the project:

This project is a web application developped in React (JS) for the front-end and with Flask for the back-end (Python). The aim of the application is to help students learn through videos, contextual help and an interactive knowledge graph gathering all the concepts explainend in the video and the relationships with each other.

# Installation

## Virtual Environment

<br>

To organize the projecty it is better to create and use a virtual env as Annotator app, but you can skip this step.

#### Prerequisites: Anaconda  

<br>

Start by running Anaconda/Conda terminal:

Create the virtual environment (if you do not have it yet):

    > conda create -n myenv python=3.7 pip pytorch
    
Activate the environment:

    > conda activate myenv

(Optional) Open VSCode with conda (if dev using VScode ide)

    > code

## Back-end (Flask)

* Make sure that you have Flask installed on your machine

* Go inside flask-server folder:
  - cd src/flask-server

* Install the requirements:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt  

  (each module's version is specified in requirements.txt)

* If you need to connect to Edurell’s mail box:
  - Go to Gmail’s login interface
  - Email address : Specified in src/flask-server/main.py **(line 43)**
  - Password : Specified in src/flask-server/main.py at **(line 44)**

## Front-end (React.js)

* Make sure that Node.js and npm are installed on the machine

* Go inside react-app folder
  - cd src/react-app  

* Install the dependencies
  - npm install

# Notes

- Pymongo issues 

  if pymongo certificate is invalid:
    1. Download https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-r3.pem 
    2. rename file .pem to .cer
    3. double click and install   
  
<br>

- To make graphs the same in 1st and this app we commented the call to the function for removing transitivity.

  * to reactivate transitivity go to line 452 of GraphKnowledge.js and decomment the line with the call.

  * // this.removeTransitivity(this.state.graph)

<br>

- Change annotation to display/consider:

  To change annotations have a look on this part of the code:

  * data.py (get_concept_instants, get_concept_vocabulary, get_concept_map, get_concept_list)

  * handle_data.py (get_definitions_fragments)

  * main.py (get_fragments, class Graphs, get_graph, graph)

  Atm on each of thoose functions the email or annotatorId fields/var are used as a filter to the DB.
  Change user informations to update the filter and obtain other annotations as result.
  This can be done also with burst or gold annotations.

<br>

- Videos folder

  the videos folder inside main.py (line ~28) has to be arranged basing on the server folder structure.

  ```python
    app.config["CLIENT_IMAGES"] = 
    "/var/www/edurell/EVA_apps/EdurellVideoAnnotation/static/videos"
  ```
<br>

- Email 

    After some months the email sender could stop working and you can find errors on register or forgot password:

    * Login to the google account with this app credentials   
    (you can find those credentials on file main.py line ~43) 
    
    * go to security settings -> allow less secure app

    * (More info -> https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)

    If still not working:

    * after log in with the google account open this link:  
      https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

    * (More info -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16512592/login-credentials-not-working-with-gmail-smtp)


<br>

# Run the application

* Open 2 terminals

  - 1st one : go to flask-server folder and run main
    - cd src/flask-server
    - python main.py  
  - 2nd one : go to react-app folder and run the start script
    - cd src/react-app
    - npm start

The app should start automatically in the default browser at this point..  
(However the url to type in the browser is the following: http://localhost:3000/)
