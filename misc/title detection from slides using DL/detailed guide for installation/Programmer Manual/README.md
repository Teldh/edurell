# Steps for automatic manual extraction from the code

**1. Install Sphinx:** 

Install the sphinx tool for automatic extraction using the following command
* _pip install sphinx_

**2. Create a Sphinx Project:**

Go to the directory where you have your python code and run this command:
* _sphinx-quickstart_

**3. Configure Sphinx 'conf.py' File**

Open the conf.py file generated by Sphinx in a text editor. Make sure the following lines are present and configured appropriately:

* import os
* import sys
* sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))               # Change '.' to the path of your Python code
* extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

**4. Generate Documentation:**

Run the following command in the terminal:
* _sphinx-apidoc -o source /path/to/your/code_

**5. Build HTML Documentation:**

Run the following command to build the HTML documentation:
* _make html_

This command will create the documentation in the _build/html directory. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view your documentation.

**Note:**
To access the already created programmer manual, download the rar files in this directory, then go to:
*  Manual for Video Evaluation -> _build -> html -> index.html
