# This line imports the OpenCV library, which is used for computer vision tasks, including image and video processing.
import cv2
# This line imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical and mathematical operations in Python. NumPy is commonly used for array manipulation and data handling.

import numpy as np
# This line imports the 'os' module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, including functions for working with files and directories.

import os
# This line imports the TensorFlow library, a popular deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks.

import tensorflow as tf
# This line imports the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library, which is commonly used for splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# This line imports the Flatten layer from the Keras library. Keras is an API for building and training deep learning models, 
# and the Flatten layer is used to convert multi-dimensional input into a one-dimensional vector.
from keras.layers import Flatten
# These lines import specific layers from TensorFlow's Keras API. LSTM is a Long Short-Term Memory layer, commonly used in recurrent neural networks. 
# Dense is a fully connected layer, and Dropout is used for regularization to prevent overfitting in neural networks.
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
# This line imports the L2 regularization method from TensorFlow. L2 regularization is used to add a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2
# This line imports the EarlyStopping callback from TensorFlow. 
# It's used during model training to stop training early if certain conditions are met, typically to prevent overfitting.
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# This line imports the Matplotlib library, which is used for creating visualizations and plotting data. 
# In this case, it's imported as plt.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
